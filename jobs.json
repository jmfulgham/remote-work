And this is your chance to help make a meaningful impact on the lives of people who struggle with their health by accelerating our ability to penetrate this market with our robust product offerings (see more below).</p>\n<p>To that end, our goal is to build the first billion-dollar brand that’s 100% remote… and need your help.</p>\n<p>To summarize the key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Salary: $110,000 - $140,000</li>\n<li>Location: 100% Remote</li>\n<li>Benefits: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k</li>\n<li>Hours: 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 (and very flexible)</li>\n<li>Culture: High-Performance but Humble (no jerks)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Who are We Looking For?</p>\n<p>A full-time, senior, full-stack, brilliant, business-savvy web architect / web developer with heavy big data experience in the direct-to-consumer e-commerce space.  It’s a full-time, 100% remote position with a flexible work/vacation schedule as lifestyle is hugely important to our company.</p>\n<p>A curious mind, desire for autonomy while excelling in an open, truly collaborative culture of high performers makes would make you a perfect fit.  These aren’t talking points.  This is what we do, now.</p>\n<p>We’re on pace to double this year and repeat that next year.  To that end, we need more help tackling some very big engineering projects so we can handle our next leg of growth.  We’re laser-focused on recruiting someone with a business mindset who loves to solve big business problems by developing beautiful, efficient code and who enjoys having immediate, visible influence on the company’s results.</p>\n<p>The ideal person is extremely results-driven and gets tremendous satisfaction from having their work see the light of day quickly… and being motivated by seeing the impact it has.  We want someone of who obsesses about and loves to code… but also someone who loves to solve big business problems.</p>\n<p>Projects include everything from handling the massive system and data load that spending $1,000,000+ monthly on paid advertising brings, to building automated workflow tools to streamline internal operations, to developing sophisticated if/then logic in our billing code to handle the creative pricing and offers we use in our customer acquisition funnels.</p>\n<p>For example, we built our own all-in-one e-commerce system in 2012 as nothing handled the complex billing and funnel logic we needed to support our sophisticated B2C marketing strategies.  However, now we’re moving over to the Shopify platform and strategically integrating our existing platform.  That requires a complex analysis on which system does which part the best and building a smart integration.</p>\n<p>As another example, we build our own custom dashboards to precisely track our advertising efforts.  To that end, we integrate with Google and Facebook’s APIs to ingest all the data they provide.  As a result, we end up with millions of rows of data a month that needs to be efficiently organized so we can use our BI tool to extract key business insights effectively.</p>\n<p>The ideal person is extremely self-motivated, loves to grind out work consistently and is comfortable being hands-on in all facets of web engineering from the browser-to-the-code-to-the-server.  Experience with marketing funnels, e-commerce systems, split testing, sales analytics, conversion rate optimization is essential.</p>\n<p>We empower our developers with a lot of autonomy and responsibility for some very meaty projects that have very large $ impacts.  To that end, this opportunity is suited only for a high-performing full-stack developer with an integrative mindset and proven ability to get things done cleanly and on time.</p>\n<p>You will work hand-in-hand with our CTO to optimize, support and manage our entire web infrastructure.  You and our two other senior devs form our core development team of 4, covering for each other as vacation and other needs arise, while working synergistically on separate projects.</p>\n<p>Just as we obsess about creating metabolism-optimizing products that get the most results in the least time, we’re looking for someone equally obsessed about doing the same thing with efficient code.</p>\n<p>While your coding skills are important, it's how fast you process information, how quickly (and accurately) you can cycle through work and how well you work with the rest of our team that's crucial.  To that end, communication is key to this role, as is the ability to self-motivate and quickly turn a business conversation into an actionable set of dev tasks that you can jump on immediately.</p>\n<p>Who is This Opportunity Perfect for?</p>\n<p>Anybody who truly is a top coder and creative architect who might relate to any of these:</p>\n<p>If you’re tired of the commute, sick of burning the midnight oil, stress is dominating your life, and the cost of real estate is eating up your retirement, this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Or, if you’ve always wanted to be a part of the thrill of a rapidly growing company, but didn’t want to move to an expensive big city with all the madness, stress and high cost that brings, this is your opportunity to stay where you are (or move to where you always wanted to go) to design your ideal life.</p>\n<p>Or, if you’re drowning in the corporate world, suffocating from constantly shifting priorities that nobody agrees on, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get work done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we can’t wait to meet you.</p>\n<p>Who Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?</p>\n<p>Our mission is to spread our metabolism-first way of living we’ve been busy perfecting for 8 years to a worldwide audience.  It’s a lifestyle that’s 100% focused on getting you the results that matter:  looking your best, feeling your best and doing your best. In the shortest time possible.  And in a way that sticks.</p>\n<p>That’s why our tag line is “Life’s Short.  Make it Count.”  It puts you back in control.  It empowers you to fix your own problems.  And it makes you want to tell the world about it.</p>\n<p>Our vision is to do this by becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that’s distributed via online, mobile and physical retail.  We’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework and high-performance culture to make this happen.  And now we’re ready for a much larger stage.</p>\n<p>We’ve built a full ecosystem of products and services that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle.  This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods and membership programs.  We’re launching a mobile app next year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more.  But ONE thing at a time, just like we’ve done for 8 years.</p>\n<p>Our next major step is rolling out our new Metabolic Living brand and centralized e-commerce website at <a href=\"http://www.metabolicliving.com\">www.metabolicliving.com</a>, using highly customized Shopify implementation, by September.  As part of this, we will sunset our old brand, Natural Health Sherpa, and consolidate our various product-driven microsites like at <a href=\"http://www.metabolicrenewal.com\">www.metabolicrenewal.com</a>.</p>\n<p>So why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed?  Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up in virtually every country.  Why is that?  Because we’re over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and toxic.  And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, exercise, movement and relaxation we need to thrive.  That’s a recipe for disaster.  And we’re seeing it.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise trap people into a 1-step-forward-2-steps back vicious cycle that actually makes them worse off.  They bounce around from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making any progress… staying trapped in a downward spiral.</p>\n<p>Rigid philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create an us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting.  Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time… or even the same person all the time.  People differ.  People change.  If that’s not respected, things will backfire.</p>\n<p>We, on the other hand, present a framework that allows you to customize your life in a way that works best for you, so you can reach your fullest metabolic potential.  Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results you want.</p>\n<p>Instead of fighting against your body or your life, we empower you to work with your body and life to create the perfect program for you.  One that’s practical.  One that’s sustainable.  One that’s enjoyable.  And, most importantly, one that delivers the results you want at any stage of life.
